**Name: NewsSpectrum**

**Concept:** A news platform that allows users to adjust the political bias of the content they see with a slider, moving from left to right or settling in the middle for a more neutral viewpoint.

**Features:**

1. **Bias Slider:** The main feature would be the ability to adjust the political bias of the news feed by moving a slider along a spectrum. 

2. **Multiple Perspectives:** For major stories, the platform could present articles from multiple sources across the political spectrum to showcase diverse viewpoints.

3. **Transparency Information:** Each article could include information about the original source and its known biases, allowing users to be more informed about where their news is coming from.

4. **Personalized News Feed:** Users can choose to follow specific topics, regions, or types of news, and the platform will curate a personalized news feed based on these preferences.

**Monetization:** The platform could be free to use, with ads generating revenue. A premium ad-free version could be offered for a monthly subscription. 

This platform would encourage users to understand different perspectives and biases in the news, contributing to a more informed public discourse. As always, thorough market research and user feedback would be critical before moving forward with this idea.
